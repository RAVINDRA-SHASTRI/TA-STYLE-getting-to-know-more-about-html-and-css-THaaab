        <h3> Bergeron</h3>
        
        <p>
            The year is 2081 and everyone has been made equal by force.
         To do this, every person who is superior in any way has been handicapped 
         (something that prevents a person’s full use of their abilities) by the government.
        
        Intelligent people are distracted by disturbing noises.
         Good dancers have to wear weights so that they do not dance t
          Attractive people wear ugly masks so they do not look better than anyone else.
           However, one day there is a rebellion and everything changes for a brief instant.

        <h3> School </h3>
        
        <p>A school teacher is narrating all the recent incidents that have happened on campus.
             First, they mention a garden where all the trees died. Pretty soon deaths of all kinds begin to occur.

        
        What Is Great About It: Most of the adults do not know how to deal with death,
         even though they want to teach children about it. It makes us realize how inefficient our education
          systems are because they can not help us deal with life’s most basic issues.
