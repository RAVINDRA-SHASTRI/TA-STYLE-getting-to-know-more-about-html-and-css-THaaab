    <h3>The Bogey Beast” by Flora Annie Steel</h3>
    <img src="assets/media/pic 4.jpg" alt="pic 4">
    <p>

A woman finds a pot of treasure on the road while she is returning from work. Delighted with her luck,
 she decides to keep it. As she is taking it home, it keeps changing. However, her enthusiasm refuses to fade away.
 What Is Great About It: The old lady in this story is one of the most cheerful characters 
anyone can encounter in English fiction. Her positive disposition (personality) tries to
 make every negative transformation seem like a gift, and she helps us look at luck as a matter
  of perspective rather than events.

        <h3>
       The Tortoise and the Hare </h3>
<p>

This classic fable tells the story of a very slow tortoise (another word for turtle) and
 a speedy hare (another word for rabbit). The tortoise challenges the hare to a race. 
 The hare laughs at the idea that a tortoise could run faster than him, but when the two
  actually race, the results are surprising.

   What Is Great About It: Have you ever heard the English expression,
  “Slow and steady wins the race”? This story is the basis for that common phrase.
   This timeless short story teaches a lesson that we all know but can sometimes forget:
   Natural talent is no substitute for hard work, and overconfidence often leads to failure.</p>
